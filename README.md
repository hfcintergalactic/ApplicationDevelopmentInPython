Introduction
------------

The ability of software engineers to analyze and solve problems and translate solutions into correct computer programs can be seen as important and fundamental skills. Throughout the study program as well as in a professional career, these skills will continuously be called upon.

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses. However, this course primarily focuses on the step-by-step implementation of a full computer program. This implementation will build upon the knowledge acquired in both development- and analyse courses. In addition, this course allows students new to programming to get familiar with the software development environment, the process of debugging software and the transformation of problem solutions to working code. The result of this will be a computer program, written by the student.
