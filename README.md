Introduction
------------

The ability of software engineers to analyze and solve problems and translate
solutions into correct computer programs can be seen as important and
fundamental skills. Throughout the study program as well as in a professional
career, these skills will continuously be called upon.

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses. However,
this course primarily focuses on the step-by-step implementation of a full
computer program. This implementation will build upon the knowledge acquired in
both development- and analyse courses. In addition, this course allows students
new to programming to get familiar with the software development environment,
the process of debugging software and the transformation of problem solutions to
working code. The result of this will be a computer program, written by the
student.
