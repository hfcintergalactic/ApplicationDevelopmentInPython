Introduction
------------

The ability of software engineers to analyze and solve problems and translate solutions into correct computer programs can be seen as important and fundamental skills. Throughout the study program as well as in a professional career, these skills will continuously be called upon.

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses. However, this course primarily focuses on the step-by-step implementation of a full computer program. This implementation will build upon the knowledge acquired in both development- and analyse courses. In addition, this course allows students new to programming to get familiar with the software development environment, the process of debugging software and the transformation of problem solutions to working code. The result of this will be a computer program, written by the student.

How to submit single assignment
---------------------------------

Your code will be **both** automatically verified and personally checked according to the criteria found in the final assignment description. For the automatic verification, we make use of AutoGradr. Make sure to register an account at <http://AutoGradr.com>! Your teacher will provide you with the course code to enroll. For more information about how Autogradr works, please see [here](docs/autogradr.md).


How to submit full calculator in week 7 before the deadline
-------------------------------------------------------------

After week 5, there are no lectures anymore. When handing in your calculator through email you **MUST** comply with the following rules:

**!!! EVERYTHING that does not comply with the rules will be considered not handed in !!!**
- Use autogrdr.com as a tool for yourself to check whether you have implemented the requirements correctly.
- Once you are ready to submit, you must send the mail to: applicationdevelopmentpython@gmail.com
- The email should not be sent to my Hogeschool Rotterdam email.
- In the email you indicate which requirements you have implemented. Use [the requirements list](docs/list-of-requirements.md) for this purpose. For example M1-M13 if you have only done the mandatory requirements and M1-M13 + A1-A5 if you have done everything.
- The various files that contain the code must be supplied in a zip file as an attachment to the email without any password protection.
- The debugging exercise should be put in the zip file as well.
- The zip file must be provided with the following name: [your student number] [your last name] [your first name]


**ONCE AGAIN:**

**!!! EVERYTHING that does not comply with the rules will be considered not handed in !!!**
