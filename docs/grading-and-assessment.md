Grading and Assessment
----------

The final results of this course will be determined according to the following
criteria.

-   Weekly progress (0% - 100%): The programming tasks need to be evaluated by
    the teacher on a weekly basis. The final assessment of this criterium is as
    follows: `Progress = Number of approved weeks / 5`

-   Final assignment (0% - 100%): The final assignment should be submitted through
    AutoGradr. The assessment of the final assignment is automatic according to
    the criteria of the assignment. The deadline for the final assignment will
    be announced during the course. Each successfully implemented requirement
    accounts for 1/18 point. Thus, The final assessment of this criterium is as
    follows: `Final assignment = Number of implemented requirements / 18`

The final grade will be determined according to the following formula.

`Grade = Progress * 3 + Final assignment * 7`

`Grade = numberOfWeeks/5 * 3 + numberOfRequirements/18 * 7`

Example grade calculation:

Student has implemented all mandatory requirements and has shown weekly progress each time. So he has 5 out of 5 weeks, and implemented the 13 mandatory requirements out of the total of 19 requirements:

`(5/5) * 3 + (13/18) * 7 = 8.1`

__Assignments both weekly and final are individual work. In case of plagiarism student(s) will be reported to the exam committee.__
