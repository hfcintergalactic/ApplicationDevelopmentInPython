Description
-----------

The ability of software-engineers to analyze and solve problems and translate
solutions into correct computer programs can be seen as important and
fundamental skills. Throughout the study program as well as in a professional
career, these skills will continuously be called upon.

Introduction
------------

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses. However,
this course primarily focuses on the step-by-step implementation of a full
computer program. This implementation will build upon the knowledge acquired in
both development- and analyse courses. In addition, this course allows students
new to programming to get familiar with the software development environment,
the process of debugging software and the transformation of problem solutions to
working code. The result of this will be a computer program, written by the
student.

Connection with other courses
-----------------------------

This course is complementary to the development- and analyse courses, its goal
is making new programmers feel familiar with solving programming tasks. Required
prior knowledge are the concepts that were introduced in the above mentioned
courses.

Course material
---------------

1. Material for theoretical session (slides).
2. All material (digital and non-digital) distributed throughout the length of
    the course.
3. Description of assignments.

Choice of programming language
------------------------------

Throughout this course, the Python 3 programming language will be used.

Schedule
--------

The length of this course is seven weeks. Students participating in this course will
work on programming tasks according to the schedule below. Weekly progress in terms
of completion of the programming tasks is part of the assessment of this course. The
final assignment will build upon all completed programming tasks. Each lesson will be
divided into two parts; a theoretical part, related to subject that will be applied in
the practical part of the lesson. Each lesson will be supervised by a teacher. The 
programming tasks according to the schedule need to be completed and approved by the 
teacher. Each programming task will contribute towards the final
assignment.
