Description
-----------

Throughout this course you will implement a calculator application that makes us of a command-line (text only) interface. The calculator will feature various functions that are used to find answers to simple calculation problems. During 5 weeks, you will incrementally add functionality to the application such that at the end of this course the calculator is implemented according to the specifications below.

It is important to keep this document as a reference, describing the criteria for implementing the functionality of the calculator. Since the application is automatically graded through AutoGradr and AutoGradr will contain rules to check the criteria below, the criteria specified in this document should be considered as strict.

Application criteria
--------------------

Your application must adhere to the following criteria:

1. The application should be implemented in the Python programming language, version 3.
2. The application should read input from the command-line (stdin, by making use of the *input* function of Python).
3. The application should provide output through the command-line (stdout, by making use of the *print* function of Python).
4. No other programming language can be used.
5. Graphical user interfaces are not supported.
6. Additional program arguments should be provided via *argv*.

If we use the word *input* in this document, we refer to a string coming from the standard input. When we use the word *output* in this document, we refer to a string printed to the standard output unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Mandatory functionality should be implemented. Optional functionality can be implemented to receive a higher grade.

Pay close attention to the following criteria:

- __You are only allowed to use the in-built + and - operators for numbers smaller than 10.__ 
- __You are not allowed to use the built-in power, square, multiplication, division, GCD or LCM functions.__
- __You are not allowed to use packages that are not approved by your teacher.__

Requirement M1): The help command (mandatory)
---------------------------------------------

The *help* command outputs the available commands upon entering *help*.

- *input*: *help*
- *output*:

```
supported functions:
"sub" arity: 2
"sum" arity: 2
"divide" arity: 2
"multiply" arity: 2
"power" arity: 2
"sqrt" arity: 1
"mod" arity: 2
"gcd" arity: 2
"lcm" arity: 2
"bin" arity: 1
```

Please make sure that precisely this string is written to stdout.

Requirement M2): The version command (mandatory)
-----------------------------------------------

The *version* command outputs version information of the calculator application. Note that we will only work on version 0.1, therefore the version should remain 0.1.

- *input*: *version*
- *output*: *calculator version 0.1*

Requirement M3): The quit command (mandatory)
---------------------------------------------

The *quit* command should immediately terminate the application.

- *input*: *quit*
- *output*:

Requirement A1): Command-line arguments (advanced)
---------------------------------------------------

Every command described above except for the *quit* command should be accepted as an argument to the application via *argv*. Instead of continuing running, the application should terminate right after executing the command.

The commands *help* and *version* should be prefixed by the characters *\--* (dash dash). An argument starting without the characters *\--* should be treated as an expression.

```
python main.py --help
supported functions:
"sub" arity: 2
"sum" arity: 2
"divide" arity: 2
"multiply" arity: 2
"power" arity: 2
"sqrt" arity: 1
"mod" arity: 2
"gcd" arity: 2
"lcm" arity: 2
"bin" arity: 1
python main.py --version
calculator version 0.1
python main.py "sum 1 1"
2
```

In case multiple arguments are provided:

```
python main.py --help --version "sum 1 1"
```

Only the first command will be processed, after executing the command the application should immediately terminated as described above.

Requirement M4): Expression processing (mandatory)
--------------------------------------------------

The expression processing functionality will need to implement processing simple (that means one operation per expression) expressions in *prefix* notation. This means that an operator should precede the operands. With processing the expression, the input should be evaluated, the appropriate function should be called and the output of that function should be written to the standard output stream.

- *input*: *operation (e.g. sum) operands*
- *output*: *result of operation on operands*
- *errors*: 
    - In case too little or too many operands are provided:
        - *output*: *invalid number of operands*
    - In case operands of the wrong type are provided:
        - *output*: *invalid operand type*
    - In case the operation is unknown (not present in the function table):
        - *output*: *unknown token*

Requirement A2): Expression processing (advanced)
-------------------------------------------------

The simple expressions of the mandatory criteria should be extended such that the operands can consist of operations on operands. This way, more complex expressions can be created such as:

`sum 1 power 2 5`

Requirement A3): Postfix expressions (advanced)
-----------------------------------------------

Implement processing of postfix expressions. Implementation of requirement A2 prior to this is necessary.

`2 3 sum 1 multiply`

Requirement A4): Infix expressions (advanced)
----------------------------------------------

Implement processing of Infix expressions. Implementation of requirement A2 prior to this is necessary.

`2 sum 3 multiply 1`

Requirement A5): The ans keyword (advanced)
----------------------------------------------

Implement the *ans* keyword, that will be replaced by the result of the last operation.

- *input*: *res instead of operand for operator (e.g. sum ans 1)*
- *output*: *result of last operation is inserted instead of the ans keyword*
- *errors*:
    - In case there is no previous result:
        - *output*: *invalid use of ans*

    - In case too little or too many operands are provided:
        - *output*: *invalid number of operands*
    - In case operands of the wrong type are provided:
        - *output*: *invalid operand type*

Grades and Assessment
----------

The final results of this course will be determined according to the following
criteria.

-   Weekly progress (0% - 100%): The programming tasks need to be evaluated by
    the teacher on a weekly basis. The final assessment of this criterium is as
    follows: `Progress = Number of approved weeks / 5`

-   Final assignment (0% - 100%): The final assignment should be submitted through
    AutoGradr. The assessment of the final assignment is automatic according to
    the criteria of the assignment. The deadline for the final assignment will
    be announced during the course. Each successfully implemented requirement
    accounts for 1/19 point. Thus, The final assessment of this criterium is as
    follows: `Final assignment = Number of implemented requirements / 19`

The final grade will be determined according to the following formula.

`Grade = Progress * 3 + Final assignment * 7`

`Grade = numberOfWeeks/5 * 3 + numberOfRequirements/19 * 7`

Example grade calculation:

Student has implemented all mandatory requirements and has shown weekly progress each time. So he has 5 out of 5 weeks, and implemented the 13 mandatory requirements out of the total of 19 requirements:

`(5/5) * 3 + (13/19) * 7 = 7.8`

__Assignments both weekly and final are individual work. In case of plagiarism student(s) will be reported to the exam committee.__

### Retake

Should the grade of the final assessment be insufficient, there will be an
opportunity to retake. The deadline for this retake will be announced during the
course.

__The grade received for the weekly progression will be maintained for the retake.__
