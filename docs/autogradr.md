The criteria in the final assignment document are implemented as rules in AutoGradr, therefore your application should strictly adhere to these criteria. Each week has a project in AutoGradr. You will need to submit the code that implements the functionality as written in the weekly assignments with these projects in AutoGradr.

In AutoGradr you will find a number of test cases in the right region of your screen. Typically, half of the test cases are hidden and half of the test cases are visible. The test case itself is displayed in the left region. A blue line denotes input to your application, while a black line denotes the expected output from your application.

Below the test case, you can submit your application. Note that the name of the entry-point to your application should be *main.py*. In case your application consists of multiple files, you can upload a zip containing all the files.

Remember to check that the programming language is set to Python 3.

When you have uploaded your file(s), AutoGradr will automatically verify your solution and present you with the result. In case your solution does not pass, it will display the lines of output that are incorrect and what was expected. Please note that this is only shown for test cases that are visible and not for hidden test cases.

When your solution passes, AutoGradr will tell you that every test case has passed.
